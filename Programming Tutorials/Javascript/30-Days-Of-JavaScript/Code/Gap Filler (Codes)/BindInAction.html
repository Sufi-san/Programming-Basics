                We want a preserved copy of a function with its context set to the object's context.
                We select a button and attach an event listener to it.
                The callback function for the event listener will be this exact preserved function copy.

                If we try to do this without .bind(), the 'this' inside the callback function will refer to the button object onto which the event listener is attached.
