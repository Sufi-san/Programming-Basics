A JavaScript style guide is a set of standards that tells how JavaScript code should be written and organized.
Writing JavaScript code syntax in a certain style according to guidelines enables convenience and simplicity especially when working with a team of developers.

Common JS Style guidelines:

Coding conventions help:
    - to write clean code
    - to improve code readability, re-useability and maintainability

Coding conventions includes
    - Naming and declaration rules for variables & functions
    - Rules for the use of white space, indentation, and comments
    Programming practices and principles

Conventions followed in '30DaysOfJavaScript':

    - We used camelCase for variables and functions.
    - All variable names start with a letter.
    - We chose to use const for constants, arrays, objects and functions. In stead of double quote, we chose to use single quote or backtick. Single quote is becoming trendy.
    - We chose to make array names plural
    - We declare class with 'PascalCase' which starts with capital letter.
    - Space around arithmetic operators, assignment operators and after comma
    - Arrow function instead of function declaration
    - Explicit return instead of implicit return if the function is one liner
    - No trailing comma in the last value of an object
    - We prefer this +=, -=, *= /=, **= instead of the longer version
    - When we use console.log() it is good to print with a tag string to identify from where the console is coming


Whatever style guide you follow be consistent. Follow some programming paradigms and design patterns. Remember, if you do not write your code in certain order or fashion it will be hard to read it. So, do a favor for yourself or for someone who is going to read your code by writing readable code.
