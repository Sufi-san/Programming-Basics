We can use loops to perform tasks that require repetition.
- Additive operations
- Traversing arrays or other data structures

Types of loops in JS:
- for
- while
- do while
- for of <variable-name> -> handy for arrays when we are not interested in indices
- for in <variable-name> -> provides the indices from 0 to n - 1. Where 'n' is length of the data collection. Can also be used to iterate over the keys of 'Object'.

Control loop flows:
- break statement, stops and breaks out of the loop
- continue statement, stops current loop and goes to the next
