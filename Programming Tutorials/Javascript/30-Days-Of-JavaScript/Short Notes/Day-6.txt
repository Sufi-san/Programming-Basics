We can use loops to perform tasks that require repetition.
- Additive operations
- Traversing arrays or other data structures

Types of loops in JS:
- for
- while
- do while
- for of -> handy for arrays when we are not interested in indices

Control loop flows:
- break statement, stops and breaks out of the loop
- continue statement, stops current loop and goes to the next
