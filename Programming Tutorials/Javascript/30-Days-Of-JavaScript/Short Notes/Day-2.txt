Non-primitive Data Types: Objects, Arrays

Primitive Data Types are immutable and Non-primitive Data Types are mutable.

When we say that something is mutable, we mean that it can be mutated: changed while still having the same identity. For example, when you grow out your hair, you are mutating yourself: you're still you, but one of your attributes is different.
In the case of primitives, all of their attributes are fully determined by their identity; 1 always means 1, no matter what, and 1 + 1 is always 2. You can't change that.
If a given int variable has the value 1, you can change it to have the value 2 instead, but that's a total change of identity: it no longer has the same value it had before. 

Immutable data types can be directly compared.
Mutable data types can NOT be directly compared.
Mutable data types use references of actual object.
Direct comparison (===) for objects and arrays checks for reference equality, not content equality
They are also called reference types and are generally not compared directly.

The built-in 'Math' object in JS provides useful mathematical functions to operate on Numbers.
(.abs, .sqrt, .pow, .floor, .ceil, .round, .random ...)

Strings can be concatenated using '+' operator or the '.concat()' method (preferred).

We can use '\' while writing long string literals to indicate it will be continued in the next line
There are many other backslash escape sequences for various tasks. (\n, \t, \\, \', \b, ...)

Template literals can be used to directly use variable inside String: 
`This is a variable value: ${variableName}`
(We can also insert expressions inside of the ${})

Though we cannot change characters, we can access them in an arraylike fashion in Strings. (str[0])
Useful String methods: 

.length, .toUpperCase, .toLowerCase,
.substr(index, number of characters to slice)
.substring(start index, end index) -> excludes end index
.split(character to split at) -> return an array of Strings split as defined by arguments
.trim() -> removes space from beginning and end of string
.includes(substring) -> returns true if exists, false otherwise
.replace(oldSubstring, newSubstring), 
.charAt(index), charCodeAt(index) -> returns ASCII of character,
.indexOf() & .lastIndexOf() -> takes substring and returns first or last index of substring if it exists and -1 otherwise, 
.concat(multiple strings), .startsWith(substring), .endsWith(substring),
.search(substring or Regex) -> returns first index of match, search value can be regular expression too.
.match(substring or Regex) -> returns match arrays based on input, return null if not found.
.repeat(number of times) -> return repeated sequence of string

Useful methods for typecasting: 
parseInt(), parseFloat(), Number(), 
using '+' sign -> (let num = "5", then (+num) will become integer 5, works for float as well)
