Truthy values: (boolean is true)
- positive and negative numbers except zero
- all strings except empty strings
- the literal boolean value 'true'
- Empty objects or arrays are also truthy

False values: (boolean is false)
- the literal boolean value 'false'
- 0
- 0n (Big Integers)
- Nan
- undefined
- null
- '', "", `` (empty strings).

Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=, ...

Comparison Operators: ==, ==, <, >, <=, >=, !=
== -> Equal in value only. Eg: '1' == 1 will be true
=== -> Equal in value and datatype. Eg: '1' === 1 will be false.

Logical Operators: &&, ||, !

Increment Operator: ++
++count -> Increment by 1 on the spot
count++ -> Increment in the next line

Decrement Operator: --

Ternary Operator: (short-hand if-else)
(condition)? <Run if true>: <Run if false>
-> Can also be used for Assignment

Operator precedence and associativity: (important points)
- operators are first grouped by precedence and then associativity
- parentheses has highest precedence
- ** operator has higher precedence than *, /, %
- ** operator has right associativity. Eg: a ** b ** c = a ** (b ** c)
- Bitwise operators (>>, <<, &, |, ^, ~) have same prority as binary operators (*, /, )

Generally, assignment operators have lower priority, bitwise and binary have medium priority, parenthesis, access calls (like function calls), exponentiation and prefix operators (increment, decrement, unary) have higher priority. 

Short circuiting: jargon for conditional evaluation
- Evaluation depends upon first value and the connection between
Eg: a && (b + c) -> If 'a' is false, there is no need to evaluate 'b + c'
Eg: a || (b + c) -> Similar conclusion if 'a' is true.

Window Methods:
alert -> popup on window to display something
prompt -> requires input from user and returns it inside the code in string from
confirm -> takes a Yes or No answer and return boolean

Date Object:

- has methods like get ->
FullYear, Month, Date, Hours, Minute, Second, Milliseconds, Time(milliseconds since Jan 1, 1970)(also called 'Unix' Time), Day (Weekday as a number)

- If object is printed as it is, it shows current time in format:
Day Month Date Year Time(HH:MM:SS) TimeType

Nullish Coalescing Operator: (??)
Assigns a value if the previously assigned values is null or undefined.
Eg:
let var1 = 5, var2 = null, var3;
var1 = var1?? 10;
var2 = var2?? 10;
var3 = var3?? 10;
console.log(var1, var2, var3); // 5 10 10
