// Write a program to check whether a given number is prime or not using loops.

/* Harry just wrote a condition inside the for-loop and then applied it's result outside
   the loop with conditional operators to determine whether a number is prime or not.
   The condition was : if(n%i == 0){prime = 0; break;}. He initially declared the prime
   variable as prime = 1.
   However, the program didn't work for 0 and 1 as an input.
   The program I made considers 0 & 1 and declares it as neither prime nor composite.
