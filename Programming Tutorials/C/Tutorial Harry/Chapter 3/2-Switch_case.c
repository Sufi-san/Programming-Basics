// Understanding Switch case-control instruction.
//  Syntax for Switch is :
//      switch (variable-expression)
//   {
//   case  (value assigned to variable-expression) :
//       /* code */;
//         break; --> //It is necessary to add this if you don't want the code for a false case to be displayed.
//   default: --> // If none of the cases are true for the value of variable, the default code is displayed.
//       /* code */;
//   }
