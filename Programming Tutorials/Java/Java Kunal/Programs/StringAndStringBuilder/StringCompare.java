            false.

        2) .equals method: when we do not want to check whether variables are pointing to same object
            and only their value needs to be checked, '.equals' method should be used.
            All pre-defined java objects have a .equals() method.

        System.out.println(a.equals(c));  // This will return true as we use .equals method to just check value.

        // Even though we imagine Strings as character arrays, we cannot simply do the following:
        // System.out.println(a[0]);  this will return an error, instead of this if we just want to
