            If object(non-primitives) is not string, java converts it to string and then concatenates/prints.
           Condition:
            There should exist at least one string expression between multiple operands for concatenation.
            e.g:  System.out.println(new ArrayList<>() + new ArrayList<>());  will not work, give error.
