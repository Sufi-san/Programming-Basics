    /* Breakdown:
        int[] roll_num;
          // declaration of array. roll_num is getting defined in stack as a reference variable. (compile time)
        roll_num = new int[5];
          // initialization of array, the actual object is being created in heap memory. (run time)
          // This is known as dynamic memory allocation
        Heap objects are not continuous, thus unlike C, allocation of memory completely depends on JVM.
        Hence, internally array objects in java may not be continuous.

        Note:
        Primitives are directly stored in stack memory
        Self-made or non-primitive types are stored heap memory
