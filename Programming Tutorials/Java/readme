An old folder named "Java Kunal" which used to exist within this directory was shifted to another directory named "DSA Journey(GH)".
This was done to place all the notes, code and assignment for that particular course in a single directory, instead of it being scattered.
The course consists of not only the basics of Java but also provides detailed information on Object Oriented Programming(OOP), Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) and other important topics related to Java Programming.
Thus, to keep all the contents of the course in one place the "Java Kunal" folder which just contained of the "Basics of Java" was moved.
