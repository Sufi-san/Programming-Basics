I like to learn about different programming languages and I feel excited when I find similarities between multiple programming languages.
This folder is dedicated to store the content I came across while learning about various programming languages.
These resources (notes/code) however, will be such that they are not a part of larger goal/course/task/application.
For example, learning C, Python or Assembly language just for the sake of familiarity and without any determined use in my future development tasks.
